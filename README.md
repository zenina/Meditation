Description:
I created this project to test some github functionality, and play with bash. This is just a simple script with a few affirmations. It utilizes some core features of bash and functions as a more extensive "bio". 

This is meant to include a rewrite of several bash functions, libraries, and snippets I've done over the years, refactored as a single repository, and wrapped around a generic context. I'm hoping to turn it into a full bash automation/orchestration repository, with several styles of functionality, but at this point it's still quite simple.

I began this project to play around with bash and color codes a bit. It's still in it's infancy. 

- functions
- aliases
- Bash order of executables
- arrays
- for loops
- eval
- set -x (bash inline debugging)
- here documents
